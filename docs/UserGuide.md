Worldly is a **desktop app for exchange students looking to manage their contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Worldly can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for Worldly.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar worldly.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add name:John Doe phone:98765432 email:johnd@example.com address:John street, block 123, #01-01 channel:EMAIL offset:+08:00 country:Singapore` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add name:NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add name:John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `name:NAME [tag:TAG]` can be used as `name:John Doe tag:friend` or as `name:John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[tag:TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `tag:friend`, `tag:friend tag:family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `name:NAME phone:PHONE_NUMBER`, `phone:PHONE_NUMBER name:NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Viewing help: `help`

Shows the description and format of all actions a user can perform with Worldly. Also displays a list of valid country names and their corresponding calling codes.

![help message](images/helpWindow.png)

Format: `help`


### Adding a person: `add`

Adds a person to the address book.

Format: `add name:NAME phone:PHONE_NUMBER email:EMAIL address:ADDRESS channel:CHANNEL offset:OFFSET [country:COUNTRY] [note:NOTE] [tag:TAG]…​`

* A tag with the person's country calling code is automatically added if it is included in the phone number.
* The channel field **cannot be left blank**. You must specify one of the allowed channels: PHONE, EMAIL, SMS, WHATSAPP, or TELEGRAM. If the channel field is omitted, the app will display an error and refuse to add the contact.
* The offset refers to offset from GMT and must be specified in +/-HH:MM. You may refer to the help window (with `help`) for a reference table of offset values.
* The country and note fields can be left blank or omitted from the command entirely.
* A person can have any number of tags (including 0). Each tag must be added with `tag:`.


Examples:
* `add name:John Doe phone:98765432 email:johnd@example.com address:John street, block 123, #01-01 channel:EMAIL offset:+08:00 country:Singapore note:does not drink alcohol tag:friends`
* `add name:Betsy Crowe tag:friend email:betsycrowe@example.com address:Newgate Prison phone:1234567 channel:TELEGRAM offset:+08:00 tag:criminal`

### Listing all persons : `list`

Shows a list of all persons in the address book. The list is by default sorted in alphabetical order of the contacts' names.

Format: `list`

### Editing a person : `edit`

Edits an existing person in the address book.

Format: `edit INDEX [name:NAME] [phone:PHONE] [email:EMAIL] [address:ADDRESS] [channel: CHANNEL] [offset: OFFSET] [country:COUNTRY] [tag:TAG]…​`

* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the currently displayed person list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing country, leaving the prefix blank (i.e. country:) will remove the existing country.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative. You can remove all the person’s tags by typing `tag:` without specifying any tags after it.
* If the currently viewed list is not the main list (e.g. if a `find` command was previously run), the index will refer to that of the **current list**, not the main list.

Examples:
*  `edit 1 phone:91234567 email:johndoe@example.com` edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person in the current list to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.

### Locating persons by name: `find`

* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

Examples:

### Saving the data

Worldly data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

Worldly data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, Worldly will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br><br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause Worldly to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Worldly home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
